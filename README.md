# 📈 Intelligent Stock Market Prediction with Sentiment Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project predicts stock prices using a hybrid approach that combines:
- **Technical Analysis**: Historical price data, moving averages, RSI, MACD
- **Sentiment Analysis**: News headlines and social media sentiment
- **Machine Learning**: Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM)

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out for Placements
- **Real-world Application**: Directly applicable to finance and trading
- **Multiple ML Techniques**: Demonstrates versatility in time series, NLP, and ensemble methods
- **Data Engineering**: Shows ability to collect, clean, and process diverse data sources
- **Business Impact**: Clear ROI and practical value for companies
- **Advanced Visualization**: Interactive dashboards and performance metrics

## 📊 Dataset Description
### Primary Data Sources:
1. **Stock Price Data**: Yahoo Finance API (OHLCV data for major stocks)
2. **News Sentiment**: NewsAPI for financial news headlines
3. **Technical Indicators**: Calculated from price data (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
4. **Market Indices**: S&P 500, VIX for market context

### Features Used:
- **Technical Features**: 20+ indicators including moving averages, volatility, momentum
- **Sentiment Features**: News sentiment scores, headline frequency, topic modeling
- **Market Context**: Sector performance, market volatility index
- **Temporal Features**: Day of week, month, quarter effects

## 🤖 Model Architecture
### 1. Feature Engineering Pipeline
- Technical indicator calculation
- Sentiment score aggregation
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Lag feature creation

### 2. Ensemble Model Approach
- **Random Forest**: For feature importance and baseline
- **XGBoost**: For non-linear patterns and interactions
- **LSTM**: For sequential/temporal dependencies
- **Meta-learner**: Combines predictions from all models

### 3. Model Selection Strategy
- Time series cross-validation
- Walk-forward analysis
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics

## 📈 Expected Outputs
1. **Price Predictions**: Next day and weekly stock price forecasts
2. **Confidence Intervals**: Uncertainty quantification for predictions
3. **Feature Importance**: What drives stock movements
4. **Trading Signals**: Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations
5. **Performance Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of results
6. **Risk Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate

## 🎖️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Machine Learning**: Ensemble methods, time series forecasting, hyperparameter tuning
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM networks for sequential data
- **NLP**: Sentiment analysis, text preprocessing, feature extraction
- **Data Engineering**: API integration, data cleaning, feature engineering
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards with Plotly/Streamlit
- **Finance**: Understanding of market dynamics and trading metrics
